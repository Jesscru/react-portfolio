      <p>I’m 24, currently living in Denver, but I grew up all over the Southeast U.S.. I went to college initially pre-med and changed my mind pretty late in the game (senior year) so when I graduated I was a little lost I traveled for about six months and enjoyed the freedom of a graduate before joining the Peace Corps and committing my next two years of life to teaching English in Ecuador. In January of 2020 I moved my entire life to Ecuador. Three short months later, the pandemic plagued the world and I was evacuated back to the states. Again lost and under pressure, I was led to remember my roots—and freshman Jessica—who likes to build and create. I have a general knack for computers and languages so when faced with whether to change my career path or not, I chose what comes naturally to me. Today, I’m enrolled in UCLA Extension’s coding bootcamp. I aspire to enter the tech world using the full-stack skills I acquire with the program as well as learning through both work and self-teaching.</p>
